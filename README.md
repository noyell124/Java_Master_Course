# Java Master Course

Welcome to my Java Master Course repository! This repository documents my journey in learning Java from scratch through an online course. Here, I am experimenting with Java concepts, patterns, and practices as I progress through the material.

## About the Course
I am currently enrolled in an online Java course that covers the basics of Java programming, object-oriented principles, and various design patterns. This repository will serve as a record of my work and progress throughout the course.

## Project Structure
- **Basics/**: Contains basic Java syntax exercises, including variables, loops, and conditionals. These code files are the simplest ones.
- **Design_Patterns/**: Demonstrates different design patterns and their implementations in Java. This section includes the first assignment in the course.

## Updates
This repository will be updated regularly as I complete different sections and exercises in the course. Check back for new content and improvements!
